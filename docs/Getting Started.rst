Getting Started
===============

.. highlight:: python

The idea of Shawk is to provide an easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving text messages.
This getting started guide will give you a quick run-down on the highlights of how to use Shawk.

Installing Shawk
----------------

Installing Shawk is easy.
Simply run `pip install shawk` to download and install the latest version.

To best understand how to use shawk, let's break it down into a few features:

- Creating a client
- Adding/removing contacts
- Sending messages
- Manually retrieving messages
- Automatically retrieving messages
- Defining behavior for new messages


Creating a client
-----------------

The first thing you'll want to do after installing shawk is create a client.
This is the main interface you'll use in Shawk.
You can define multiple clients, but for the sake of this tutorial, we'll just use one.

We'll say our Gmail login username is `"username@gmail.com"` and our password is `"password"`.

We can create our client like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import shawk

    user = "username@gmail.com"
    password = "password"
    client = shawk.Client(user, password, inbox=False)


Adding/removing contacts
------------------------

Adding contacts will be helpful for understanding who texted your client or specifying who you would like to text in an easy and readable manner.

You can add them as such:

.. code-block:: python

    client.add_contact(1234567890, 'Verizon', 'Josh')

You can similarly remove them in any of the following ways:

.. code-block:: python

    client.remove_contact(contact) # Where contact is some Contact object. More on that later.
    # or
    client.remove_contact(number=1234567890)
    # or
    client.remove_contact(name='Josh')


Sending messages
----------------

You're limited to texting only your contacts you've previously defined, or those whose explicit address you have obtained.
This is, in-part, a restriction to prevent spam bots from abusing Shawk, but also a means of simplifying Number to Address mappings.

So, after you've defined a contact, you can text them by specifying their name, number, or Contact:

.. code-block:: python

    client.send('Hey, Josh!', name='Josh')
    # or
    client.send('Hey, Josh!', number=1234567890)
    # or
    client.send('Hey, Josh!', contact)


Manually retrieving messages
----------------------------

There are two ways to get new messages in Shawk: Manually or Automatically.

We can get the new ones manually by first setting up our inbox and refreshing it:

.. code-block:: python

    client.setup_inbox(password, auto=False)

    client.refresh_inbox()

This will handle the IMAP server connection for retrieving new messages to your Gmail account.

You can actually use a distinct Gmail account from the one you use to send messages, but we won't focus on that for this simple tutorial.
As always, read the rest of the docs if you'd like to know more about that.


Automatically retrieving messages
---------------------------------

You can configure Shawk to automatically retrieve new messages for you pretty easily.
This will cause the client to refresh its inbox periodically on time interval (found in client.refresh_interval).

To do this, setup your inbox as such:

.. code-block:: python

    client.setup_inbox(password, auto=True)

Boom. Done. Your client now automatically pings the server and looks for new messages!

You can configure the time interval with `client.set_interval()`, more on that in the docs.


Defining behavior for new messages
----------------------------------

By default, shawk will simply print the contents of the new messages when it finds them.

That's not particularly useful, so we'll let you dictate how Shawk `should` be used.

This default behavior can be overridden by defining a handler function that receives a client and message.
This handler function is just a callback function.
You'll attach the handler function either with the `handler=handler` argument during Client initialization, or by calling `client.set_handler(handler)` later.

You can also skip the `setup_inbox()` call by initializing your Client with `inbox=True`.

You can define your own behavior as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def handler(client, msg):
        print("Hey, we're popular! %s texted us!" % msg.sender)
        print("Received: %s" % msg.text)

        client.send("I got your text!", msg.sender)

    c = shawk.Client('username@gmail.com', 'password', inbox=True, auto=True, handler=handler)

Naturally, you'll do something a bit more meaningful in your handler function.
But since it's a simple python function, you've got free reign to interface with your scripts however you like.

I hope you've found that Shawk is pretty easy to use, yet very powerful, since it allows your users to provide input and receive output via SMS, for free.
