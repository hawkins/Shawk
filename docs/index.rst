Shawk's documentation - Welcome!
================================

Shawk is a Python module designed to make sending and receiving SMS text messages easy for devices running Python.
With internet of things compatibility in mind, this module has been designed to function fully on Raspberry Pi devices and be easy to use in that context of scripting.

If you're new to Shawk, I suggest you check out the :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started>` page.
